			Write a Java program to calculate total amount of sale based on the unit price and quantity of a product taken.
			User should be able to enter unit price and quantity.
			Then the program will perform calculations and display amounts.
			The discount rate is 10% for the quantity purchased between 100 and 120 units, and 15% for the quantity purchased greater than 120 units.
			If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate is 0%.
			See the example output as shown below:
			Input:
			Enter unit price: 25
			Enter quantity: 110
			Output:
			Grand Total: $ 2750.0
			Discount: 10%
			Discount applied: $ 275.0

			Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending

			Input: 
			Enter price in cents: 95â†µ
			Output:
			Your change is 0 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickels.


			Remember:
			1 quarter = 25 cents.
			1 dimes = 10 cents.
			1 nickels  = 5 cents.
			you will need to use assignment and shor hand operators for this task. Good luck (edited)
